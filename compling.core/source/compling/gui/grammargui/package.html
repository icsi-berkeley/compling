<h2>Package Specification</h2>

 <p>
 This package defines a simple GUI to to load a .pref file, to show
 its contents, and to analyze a sentence using the loaded grammar.

 <p>
 The main GUI class is <a href="#GrammarBrowser">GrammarBrowser</a>. It extends 
 a jface <a href="org.eclipse.jface#ApplicationWindow">ApplicationWindow</a>. 
 Two methods are crucial for the initialization (they override the analogous 
 ApplicationWindow's methods):
 <ul>
  <li>
  <a href="#GrammarBrowser.createMenuManager">GrammarBrowser.createMenuManager</a>: 
    main menu creation</li>
  <li>
  <a href="#GrammarBrowser.createContent">GrammarBrowser.createContent</a>: 
    actual content of the ApplicationWindow</li></ul>

<p> 
Menu actions are implemented in the 
<a href="#GrammarBrowserAction">GrammarBrowserAction</a> class, which defines 
all the application's menus. Each Action subclass represents one. 
The run() method implementation is straightforward: it calls a
suitable method defined by the GrammarBrowser class.
All menu action handlers in GrammarBroser are of the form 
handle&lt;ActionName&gt;.

<p>
The application window content is made of two SashForms. One is horizontal
and divides the interactive area from the bottom part that contains the output
from the sentence parsing process. The other is contained in the former's upper
section and contains the left and right parts, both of the implemented using
CTabFolders.

<p>
The class <a href="#TypeSystemHtmlPanel">TypeSystemHtmlPanel</a> displays
the actual content of the Schema/Construction/Ontology. The model is 
implemented mostly using Eva's code for the corresponding Swing tree model
with a few modifications. 

<p>
The Schema/Construcion/Ontology hierarchies are shown in a tree. 
Events (mouse clicks) originating from the tree elements are captured in 
TypeSystemHtmlPanel's constructor. There, a reference to a
IGrammarBrowserController is used to notify selections to the main application 
window.

<p>
The ModelChangedEvent, ModelChangedEventManager classes, and the 
IModelChangeListener interfaces define data types used for changes in a generic
data model. Used in GrammarBrowser to notify menus that the a new grammar has
been loaded. Clients register and unregister themselves with GrammarBrowser 
object using 
<a href="#GrammarBrowser.addModelChangeListener">GrammarBrowser.addModelChangeListener</a>
and 
<a href="#GrammarBrowser.removeModelChangeListener">GrammarBrowser.removeModelChangeListener</a>.

<p>
The <a href="#Util">Util</a> class defines various utility methods. It probably
belongs to some other package, for I left it here for simplicity.

<p>
The <a href="#WindowList">WindowList</a> class defines a window showing the list
of the external output window. Not yet implemented/used.
